  Based on a project
    by Mandi Fix and Gregor Passolt
    Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management
    University of Washington

    fix@uw.edu, gregorp@uw.edu

    June 2010

    Functions that enable the creation of forests with randomized 
    stands and holes using a Voronoi tesselation approach with
    several options for generating seed points.


  Modifications made
   Jan 2010
    Cleaned code, standardized names
    increased readability

    Added "lattice" method of point selection

   Summer 2011
    Implemented edge deletion, revised data structures (elimiated Spatstat's ppp class)
    Eliminated dependency on package "tripack"
    Enabled combinations of point patterns. Removed "grid" point pattern (lattice is better)
    Started work on GUI--incomplete

   Fall 2011
    Ran simulations, cleaned handling of control parameters, fixed aspect ratio problems
    Re-created hole creation to get more predictable number of tiles out
    Re-wrote clustering point process to reduce variability
    New plotting routine (based off of the one from package deldir)
    
   Winter 2012
    fixed bugs in plotting with different aspect ratios, enable adjustable margins
    Wrote wrapper to hit targets (rland())
    Analyzed target-hitting ability
    made GUI for rland
    documented in roxygen style

   Summer 2012
    added GAM fitting routines
    turned into a package
